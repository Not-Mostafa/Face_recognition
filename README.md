  Need to improve by making one single GUI for full options
  Run Photo_Capture.py and capture users
  Image_Encoder.py Encodes and Saves automaticly files in Encodes dirictory while Image_Comparasion.py makes sure no duplicates
  
# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

  Still need to make this file later
  Edit config.py to customize:
  python

# Database Configuration
