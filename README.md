## üì¶ Required Libraries

- `opencv-python` ‚Äî For webcam video capture and displaying frames.
- `face_recognition` ‚Äî For face detection and recognition.
- `dlib` ‚Äî Dependency used by `face_recognition`.
- `numpy`, `cmake` ‚Äî Additional required dependencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps (Recommended)

> üêç Use **Python 3.9** ‚Äî Most stable version for `dlib`. Install from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/python-39/9P7QFQMJRFP7).

### 1. Set Up Python 3.9
Make sure it's added to your PATH during installation.

### 2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or VS Code) and run the following:

```bash
# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install CMake (required for dlib)
pip install cmake

# Install dlib (used by face_recognition)
pip install dlib

# Install face_recognition
pip install face_recognition

# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

# Install compatible version of NumPy
pip install numpy==1.26.4
